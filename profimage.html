		<p> My goal, as a computer scientist, is simple. I wish to successfully develop and optimize tools that can benefit the lives of others. Seeing the influence technology has on the facets of life we value inspired me to change majors and pursue an impactful career. Currently, my primary interests lie in back-end software development, database administration, <a href="https://www.smartnation.sg/" target="_blank"> cloud-based urban integration</a>, and <a href="https://ambientclinical.com/" target="_blank"> clinical analytics</a>. However, the position I hold within an organization is not of too much importance to me. Rather, I prioritize fitting within teams wherever I am most needed and can contribute to the collective. <br> <br>

		Computer science is a field that relies on one's ability to draw from previous endeavors and apply learned skills to new projects. My experience at Texas A&M, both academic and extracurricular, has greatly contributed to my professional skill set. Through the projects I have undertaken and my extracurricular involvement, I have gained invaluable soft skills such as project development, self-guided learning, team building, intuition and, most importantly, a passion for creating. I believe skills like these are vital to the success of any project-based team and are practiced by the most successful organizations. I wish to apply what I have learned thus far in a professional setting and see myself grow as a result of my work. <br> <br>

		My experience with programming, although somewhat limited, has set a foundation for me moving forward with my career. I have undertaken projects involving object-oriented programming, hardware simulation, algorithm optimization, data modeling, robotics, and web development (as you can tell by the website in front of you). Collectively, these projects reflect my fundamental knowledge of various branches of computer science and have opened up opportunities for me to pursue larger-scale endeavors. They have also reinforced my passion regarding the industry and serve as motivation for me to pursue growth in my expertise. </p>
