		<p> Hello, I'm Ali! </p> 
		<p id="text"> 
			I'm a third-year computer science major from Dallas. I currently attend Texas A&M University, and my involvement with campus has been quite diverse, including 
			<a href="https://tamuideaal.wordpress.com/" target="_blank"> leadership development</a>, 
			<a href="https://www.nami.org/" target="_blank"> philanthropy work</a>, <a href="https://www.tamuchipsibeta.org/" target="_blank"> Greek life</a>, and <a href="https://12thman.com/sports/2015/3/23/GEN_20140101165.aspx" target = _blank>music</a>. <br> <br> 
			Outside of coding, my passions and pastimes involve photography, music, cars, and sneaker trade. The underlying technology behind these interests is the foundation of my career interest and swayed me into changing my field of study during my second year of university. <br><br>
			I am also a first-generation college student within my family. I take great pride in the fact that I can start a legacy that involves pursuing education and am grateful for the opportunities that have been provided for me.
